# DialogFlow Bot

This section looks at the DialogFlow bot created using Google's DialogFlow. The bot is hosted completely online. However, the ZIP'd version of the system can be retrieved from the *bot.zip* file.

## Actions
The action server for Google's DialogFlow is known as *Fulfilments*. The bots calls the *get_recc* GET request from the *https://restaurantweb.azurewebsites.net/* API. The source code for the API can be seen in the API file. 

It is important to note that the API system for the bot is currently unavailable to use as the Azure subscription is paused in order to stop unnecessary charges from being made.
